  <p>My name is Dipankar Jain, and I am currently a Junior in Computer Engineering at Virginia Tech.
  <br>Though out my collegiate career, I have learned many things that has helped me become who I am today.
  <br>Starting my freshmen year, I was offered a leadership position in a rocketry design team that has helped
  <br>me learn how to effectively delegate and communicate with a group of freshmen engineers effectively.
  <br>I applied this newly gained knowledge well into my sophomore year when I joined my first official research
  <br>team. At Terrestrial Robotics Engineering and Controls Lab (TREC), I learned to communicate with graduate
  <br>level students and professors effectively that helped me learn many new tools being developed within the lab.
  <br>As a result, I worked directly under a professor and we solved various problems in collision control and error
  <br>detection.
  <p>
  <br>More about me, I like to think myself as a gregarious human being. I enjoy going out of my way to meet new people
  <br>and learn more about them.  I feel that it helps me become a better person every time; as a result, that is why
  <br>chose an engineering major.  I enjoy working together with other people and I knew that becoming part of a team
  <br>will not only help me improve my analytical skills but will also teach me how to comprise and cover up other peopleâ€™s
  <br>weaknesses.
  <p>
  <br>Because of my current standing and beliefs, I believe I feel that I am well prepared to be
