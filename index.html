  <p>My name is Dipankar Jain, and I am currently a Junior Computer Engineering Student at Virginia Tech.
  <br>Though out my collegiate career, I have learned many things that has helped me become who I am today.
  <br>Starting my freshmen year, I was offered a leadership position in a rocketry design team that has helped
  <br>me learn how to effectively delegate and communicate with a group of freshmen engineers effectively.
  <br>I applied this newly gained knowledge well into my sophomore year when I joined my first official research
  <br>team. At Terrestrial Robotics Engineering and Controls Lab (TREC), I learned to communicate with graduate
  <br>level students and professors effectively that helped me learn many new tools being developed within the lab.
  <br>As a result, I worked directly under a professor and we solved various problems in collision control and error
  <br>detection.
